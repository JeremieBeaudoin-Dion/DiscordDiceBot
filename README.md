A simple bot to roll "Chimera" dice, which are like fate dice

The commands are:

    "Type `!roll` to roll 3 chimera dice\n" \
    "Type `!roll X` to roll X chimera dice\n" \
    "Type `!roll X dX` to roll X dX dice\n" \
    "Type `!sroll ____ ` to roll a secret dice. The result will be sent to the GM\n" \
    "Type `!stats` to get the statistics of the rolls\n" \
    "Type `!startgame` to reset game stats\n" \
    "Type `!whisper` to whisper something to the GM\n" \
    "Type `!about X` to know more about something\n" \
    "Type `!X` and something might happen ;)"
    
There are a few hidden messages added for fun with this bot. For example: if you type !Marco, the bot will reply Polo!
